                    <p>The martial class of the Grand Duchy, the Knight represents the backbone of the state, being at the same
                       time the core of their armies and the landowners who oversee the majority peasant populance.</p>
                    <p>While officials of the state that are not members of one of the Knightly Orders exist there are far and few
                       in between their positions of power being granted only due to their unique skills (commerce, magic, religion 
                       etc)</p>
                    <p>Besides these exceptions the Knights represent the Grand Duchy in all matters, wether as the army fighting 
                       any external foes or in their own lands crusading to clear any monsters that would threathen the peasantry
                       or acting as patrons for the building of new roads, churches or markets.</p>

                    <h3>Faction Relationship: Grand Duchy Favored+</h3>
                    <p> To be a kight of the Grand Duchy is to wield a huge ammount of power
                        and influence, both military power and civil one thus the title is 
                        only awarded to the sons and daughters of the Grand Duchy and on very 
                        rare cases to those foreigners that have shown themselves as 
                        extraordinary heroes and friends of the Grand Duchy.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Attribute: Str 6+</h3>
                    <p> A Knight is a warrior, defending his country on the field of battle wether
                        mounted or on foot, to fall short when battle is met is to not be worthy of
                        the title and to have it stripped from you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Qualification Roll: Soc 7+</h3>

                        good impression on the members of the order, or to be born Grand Duchy
