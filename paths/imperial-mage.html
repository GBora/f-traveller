                    <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>Official battle mages of the Empire, Imperial Mages are feared in the Legions for their power and yet respected for the magical support they can offer to the troops they lead.</p>

                    <p>Trained in special War Colleges which exist in only the most secure and advanced Empire cities and bases, Imperial mages receive a rich education focusing on leading troops, tactics, strategy, meele, harnesing their arcane energies into potent blasts and of course magic.</p>

                    <p>Choosing to specialise as either a Red, Black or White Mage will lead the inniatite to learning the misteries of either Fire Magic, Necromancy or Healing Magic.</p>

                    <p>Beyond their duties in dominating the battlefield with magic, Imperial Mages also offer their counsel to the Legion's General on matters of strategy or dealing with magical phenomena, they are also asinged to War Colleges as pure scholars where they advance the Empire's understanding of magic.</p>

                    <h2>Requirements</h2>
                    <h3>Faction Relationship: Empire Neutral+</h3>
                    <p>Imperial Mages are part of the officer corps for the Imperial Legions, thus access to the War Colleges where the mages receive their training will only be given to loyal citizens of the Empire or exceptional foreigners who are ready to pledge themselves into the Empire's service.</p>
                    <h3>Attribute: Soc 7+</h3>
                    <p>Every Imperial Mage receives an officer commision after they finish their training thus, they are expected to be both a model to uphold to their troops and to be able to command them on the field of battle.</p>
                    <h3>Qualification Roll: Magic 6+</h3>
                    <p>Acceptance into the War Colleges and then further on into one of the Red, Black or White Councils is dependant on showing an aptitude with magic, altough the training requires a hefty sum the Empire is willing to grant scholarships to those they feel are talented.</p>
