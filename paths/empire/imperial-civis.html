                    <p>Citizens of the Empire, and the ones that ultimately are
                      to praise or blame for it's success, they farm the land,
                      work the forges, staff it's libraries and provide the raw
                      conscripts for it's infamous Legions.</p>
                    <p>While the emperors and senators think of themselves as
                      sallying forth and conquering or civilizing the world in
                      the name of the Empire, there isn't a fort or road built,
                       a statue erected or sword forged without one of the
                       common people putting their back to it.</p>
                    <p>Having different skill sets whether they work with their
                       hands or with their wisdom and whether they hail from
                        one of the Empire's huge cities or one of it's new
                        colonies, the civis display abilities that make them
                        the envy of all other kingdoms and the builders of
                        the civilised world.</p>

                    <h3>Faction Relationship: Empire Neutral</h3>
                    <p>As they are the citizens of the Empire,
                      the civis are expect to at least nominally follow it's
                       rules and be in good standing with the Imperial
                       Government, the local officials might not keep track of
                       the day to the life of every countryman but high crimes
                       and betrayals can easily lead to all rights and
                       privileges being thrown aside as the Empire no longer
                        considers you a citizen</p>
                    <h3>Attribute: End 5+</h3>
                    <p>Surviving in the empire is easier than in some other
                      human nations but it is no easy task, one must be ready
                      to toil either with the body or the mind.</p>
                    <h3>Qualification Roll: None/Soc 5+</h3>
                    <p>If born in the Empire you are automatically considered
                      a citizen, in the cases that one wants to become a citizen
                       or needs to due to their lands being conquered or
                       colonised by the Empire, they can swear an Oath of
                       Allegiance and renounce their old citizenship they
                       will then be tested by the agents of the local governor
                       and depending on the result be admitted or not.</p>
