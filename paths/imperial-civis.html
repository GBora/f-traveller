                    <p>Official battle mages of the Empire, Imperial Mages are feared in the Legions for their power and yet respected for the magical support they can offer to the troops they lead.</p>

                    <p>Trained in special War Colleges which exist in only the most secure and advanced Empire cities and bases, Imperial mages receive a rich education focusing on leading troops, tactics, strategy, meele, harnesing their arcane energies into potent blasts and of course magic.</p>

                    <p>Choosing to specialise as either a Red, Black or White Mage will lead the inniatite to learning the misteries of either Fire Magic, Necromancy or Healing Magic.</p>

                    <p>Beyond their duties in dominating the battlefield with magic, Imperial Mages also offer their counsel to the Legion's General on matters of strategy or dealing with magical phenomena, they are also asinged to War Colleges as pure scholars where they advance the Empire's understanding of magic.</p>
